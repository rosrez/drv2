hrtimer
=======

It is possible to achieve subjiffy resolution with high-res timers 
(notice that jiffies does not change during the sequence below). 

However, high-res timers still operate with microsecond precision (about 10 or 20 us). 
Setting the timer period to 1 or 5 ms does not improve timer resolution;
the timer still fires at about 10 us intervals.
 
We can observe from the sequence that we are in a (soft) interrupt context and 
that the timer gets serviced by one of the softirq kernel threads.
