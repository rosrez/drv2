hrtimer
=======

It is possible to achieve subjiffy resolution with high-res timers (jiffies
does not change during the sequence). However, high-res timer
still operate with microsecond precision (about 10 us).

We can see that we are in interrupt context and that the timer gets serviced
by softirq kernel thread.

hrtimer: exiting

We changed the ns setting for the timer period to 5 ms, but timer still fires at about 10 us intervals.
